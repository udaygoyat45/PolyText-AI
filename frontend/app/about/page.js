                <p className="text-gray-700 font-bold">What is PolyText</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">PolyText AI is a free web application that arouse from our frustration that many applications and websites charge users for summaries of books, whether that is related to productivity, fiction, or non-fiction. Therefore, we decided to create PolyText AI as a free alternative to provide textbook summaries. PolyText AI's core purpose is a sophisticated suite of NLP algorithms that are fined tuned to show complex ideas into digestible summaries that retain the essence of the original text. PolyText AI serves the purpose of accessibility in the educational technology space, and it challenges the status quo where knowledge is behind a paywall. Our application fights against the widespread frustration among students, educators and self-learners who encounter financial barriers while accessing quality summaries of textbook and literary works. Currently the educational landscape is filled with costly subscription models and PolyText AI serves as a haven for free learning, embracing the idea that dissemination of knowledge should be free.
